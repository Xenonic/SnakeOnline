# SnakeOnline
A small singleplayer and multiplayer version of classic Snake.

### Running Your Own Multiplayer Server
This game uses UDP hole punching to setup peer to peer connections, [this page](https://github.com/XenonicDev/P2PPresider) holds the source code for the compatible middleman server. (Each Release contains a 64 bit Windows binary you can use instead of building the presider yourself.)
